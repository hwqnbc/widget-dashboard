# Widget lessons & refinements

Hard-won fixes from building the game/character widgets (Round Clock, Six Seven,
Sword Ninja, Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect 4, Memory). **Read this before building or
tweaking a board / character / animation widget** — most entries are bugs a user
reported and asked to fix, captured so they don't recur.

## Layout & alignment (the ones that bit us most)

1. **A grid board grew as pieces were placed.** CSS grid tracks default to
   `min-*: auto`, so a placed SVG can push its `1fr` track past its share and
   expand the board (which then spills into the scrollable card). **Fix:** every
   grid cell gets `minWidth: 0; minHeight: 0` (and `overflow: 'hidden'` as a
   safety net). Applied in Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect 4, Memory.

2. **"Circles" rendered as ellipses and the SVG sat off-centre.** Connect 4's
   first cut used flex columns with *mismatched* row/column gaps and
   `aspectRatio` fighting `flex`, so holes were oval and heads weren't centred.
   **Fix:** lay the board out as a real CSS grid (`repeat(n, 1fr)` both axes,
   uniform `gap`) so cells are square, and render each disc as an inner circle
   sized off one axis — `width: '86%'; aspectRatio: '1 / 1'` — centred with
   `display:'grid'; placeItems:'center'`. A circle sized this way is always
   round regardless of tiny cell non-squareness.

3. **Board must fit the card in *both* dimensions and never overflow.** Sizing
   off width alone overflowed vertically. Put the board in a
   `containerType: 'size'` wrapper and size it with container-query units:
   - square board: `width/height: 'min(100cqmin, <cap>px)'`
   - non-square (Connect 4 is 7:6): `width: 'min(100cqw, calc(100cqh * 7 / 6))'`
     plus `aspectRatio: '7 / 6'`.

4. **`CardContent` is `overflow: 'auto'`.** Anything that spills past the widget
   body flashes a scrollbar (the Round Clock's orbiting head did this; so did the
   growing board). Keep content bounded — rules 1–3 prevent it; for decorative
   overflow use `overflow: 'hidden'` on the widget root.

5. **Centring an SVG with a non-square / asymmetric viewBox:** wrap it in a fixed
   box with `placeItems:'center'`; if it must read on arbitrary background
   colours, put it on a white disc (Memory cards, Connect 4 discs).

## Touch / drag

6. **react-grid-layout swallows taps.** Interactive controls inside a widget need
   `className="widget-no-drag"` **and** `onMouseDown`+`onTouchStart`
   `stopPropagation` — `onMouseDown` alone never fires on touch, which is why a
   button felt dead on mobile. `WidgetBoard` sets `draggableCancel=".widget-no-drag"`.

## SVG animation

7. **One-shot `animation … forwards` plays on mount → a flash.** Gate it behind an
   `animate`/`interacted` flag that is false until the first real interaction
   (Sword Ninja draw; the looping-ninja win celebration flashed a sheathe on
   mount until we deferred `animate` to the first loop tick).

8. **To loop a toggle-based animation, toggle the state on an interval** and reuse
   the existing one-shot keyframes — no keyframe rewrite (the winner celebration
   loops the sword draw/sheathe this way).

9. **Verifying animations:** pause `document.getAnimations()` and set
   `currentTime`, or screenshot at the true extremes. Mid-cycle frames look
   identical — an early "the two screenshots look the same" report came from
   sampling both near the mid-swing.

## State / redux

10. **`useWidgetField` fallbacks must be stable module constants** (never an inline
    `Array(n).fill(...)`), or the selector returns a fresh reference every render
    and loops effects. Use the `coerce` callback to validate arrays/enums.

11. **Keep reducers pure.** Shuffle/deal with `Math.random` in an effect, not in
    `defaultWidgetData`/the reducer (Memory deals its deck in an effect when
    `cards.length !== size*size`).

12. **redux-persist writes are debounced.** Assert game state via the **DOM**, not
    an immediate `localStorage` read — a verification script mis-read stale state
    this way.

13. **Timers get cleaned up.** AI "thinking" latency, the Memory resolve delay, and
    the celebration loop all live in `useEffect` with `clearTimeout`/
    `clearInterval` cleanup, so a reset/unmount can't drop a stale move onto a
    fresh board.

## Game UX / AI

14. **Easy AI must not look like it's throwing.** Pure ε-greedy randomness ignored
    obvious wins/blocks and read as intentional losing. The rule that felt right:
    **take an immediate win → block the opponent's immediate win → else random.**
    Medium/Hard use depth-limited alpha-beta.

15. **Simulate "thinking":** the computer commits its move after a short *random*
    `setTimeout` (≈0.4–1.2s) instead of instantly.

16. **Guard destructive control changes.** Any control that restarts/reshuffles
    (mode, difficulty, grid size, match rule) pops a `ConfirmDialog` **only while a
    game is in progress**; the explicit **New game** button stays unguarded.
    Treat "changing a setting" and "starting a new game" as the same action.

17. **Turn/score as an icon, not text.** `PlayerBadge` (head + label) reads faster
    than "Toy to move"; on game end the winner's looping `WinnerCelebration`
    overlays the dimmed board (the winning-line glow stays visible behind).

18. **Gate human→human hand-offs.** In pass-and-play, a turn pass with no pause
    invites mis-clicks into the next player's move. A brief `TurnBanner` overlay
    ("X's turn", tinted to `PLAYER_COLOR`) that locks the board, auto-dismisses
    (~1s via `useHandoff`) and is tap-to-skip fixes it. Announce **only** on a
    genuine pass — never on reset, never when the move ended the game, and never
    on the computer's turn (its thinking delay already gates). Colour-code the
    players (`PLAYER_COLOR`: toy teal / ninja ice-blue) so the active one is
    obvious. The banner's overlay sits on top and intercepts taps, which is a
    second guard on top of the handler's `if (hand.player) return`.

## Reuse

19. Extract shared pieces rather than inlining: character heads (`ToyHead`,
    `NinjaHead`) and their palettes (`toyPalette`, `ninjaPalette`) as **their own
    modules** — a component file that also exports a constant trips the
    `react-refresh/only-export-components` lint. Also shared: `PlayerBadge`,
    `WinnerCelebration`, `ConfirmDialog`, `TapStage`, `SixSevenFigure`,
    `SwordNinjaFigure`, `toyParts`, `Hand`, hooks `useNow` / `useWidgetField`. Use
    an **extensible registry** for variant sets (Memory's `FACE_MOTIFS`).

## Verification & ops

20. Every change: `npm run build` (tsc + vite) **and** `npm run lint`, then drive it
    in headless Chromium (`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`) via `data-testid` hooks.
    Watch for assertions polluted by new UI — counting `svg[aria-label="Toy figure"]`
    globally once included the new footer `PlayerBadge` head, not just board marks.

21. Environment quirks: `pkill -f vite` returns exit 144 and aborts a compound
    bash command — run commit/push separately. The Pages green check can't be
    confirmed from this environment (cached Actions API, `github.io` blocked) —
    hand the user the URL instead.

22. Branch hygiene: when the working branch is fully merged, reset it from
    `origin/main` before new work; fast-forward merges keep history linear.

## Physics / pointer interaction (Archery)

23. **Projectile + drag aiming.** Keep world = SVG viewBox units and size the
    container to the viewBox aspect ratio, so pointer→world is a straight scale
    off `getBoundingClientRect` (no letterbox maths). Run the flight in
    `requestAnimationFrame` (timestamp delta → `t`) and **`cancelAnimationFrame`
    on unmount/reset**. Only the *outcome* (score, turn) is persisted — aiming
    and the in-flight arrow are transient, so a mid-flight reload just returns to
    the shooter's turn. Use unified **pointer events** (`onPointerDown/Move/Up` +
    `setPointerCapture`, `touchAction:'none'`) so mouse and touch share one path.
    Embed reused character `<svg>` heads inside the scene with `<foreignObject>`
    so they scale with the viewBox. For deterministic tests, mirror the physics
    constants, solve a launch that lands in the target hitbox, and invert the
    slingshot mapping (`dragΔ = −v/K`) to synthesise the pointer drag.
